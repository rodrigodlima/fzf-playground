Repository to play with fzf command line fuzzy finder

## What is fzf?

fzf is a command-line fuzzy finder. What it's mean? fzf is a tool that finds items based on approximate matching.

Instead of requiring you to type the exact name of a file, command, or item, fzf can find results even if you type only parts of the word, letters out of order, or incomplete fragments.

__Simple example:__
If you have a file called “application-settings.json”
and you type only “apsjs” in fzf, it can still find it.

So “fuzzy” here means similarity-based searching, non-exact matching, or tolerance to typing errors.
